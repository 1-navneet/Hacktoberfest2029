## What Is Hacktoberfest?

Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source, organized annually by DigitalOcean (in partnership with community sponsors) to encourage people (developers, designers, writers, and non-coders too) to get involved in open-source projects. 

Since its inception, the mission remains simple:

- Encourage contributions to open projects  
- Bring in new contributors  
- Celebrate open source communities and maintainers  
- Provide incentives (digital badges, T-shirts, recognition) 
Over the years, Hacktoberfest has grown from just hundreds of participants to tens of thousands.

### Key Dates in 2025

- Hacktoberfest 2025 is officially open. 
- The global kickoff ‚ÄúFrom Code to Community‚Äù is on **October 1st**, virtual gathering. 
- Events (satellite sessions, workshops, meetups) are held throughout October. 


## How to Participate: Step by Step

Here‚Äôs how you can get involved and make the most of Hacktoberfest:

### 1. **Register / Sign Up**

Go to [Hacktoberfest.com](https://hacktoberfest.com) and connect your GitHub account. This links your contributions to your profile.
Once you register, you‚Äôll get a digital badge (or ‚Äúpin‚Äù) that upgrades as you complete accepted PRs. 

### 2. **Find Suitable Projects**

- Only repositories that have opted in (i.e. have the `hacktoberfest` topic) count as eligible. 
- Many projects label beginner-friendly issues as **‚Äúgood first issue‚Äù** or **‚Äúhelp wanted‚Äù**. These are great for newcomers. 
- You can contribute to non-code areas as well: docs, translation, design, writing, tutorials, etc. 
- Keep your eyes on Hacktoberfest‚Äôs official event listings and community shared project lists. 

### 3. **Make Pull or Merge Requests**

- Fork or clone the repo  
- Create a new branch  
- Make your changes or additions  
- Submit a PR (or merge request)  
- Be sure to follow the project‚Äôs contribution guidelines  
- Maintain good PR hygiene: clear commit messages, description of what you did, link to issue (if any)  
- Engage with maintainers: respond to feedback and revise if needed  

### 4. **Ensure PRs Are Accepted / Approved**

For a PR to count:

- The repository must be eligible (have `hacktoberfest` topic)  
- The PR must be merged, **or** labeled `hacktoberfest-accepted` by a maintainer  
- Some PRs may be accepted after the October window within a review grace period 
- The total needed for ‚Äúcompletion‚Äù is currently **6 accepted PRs** in many Hacktoberfest editions. 

### 5. üéÅ Hacktoberfest 2025 Rewards

- ü™™ **Holopin** ‚Äî Earn a digital Hacktoberfest badge + unique Holopin sticker for socials.  
- üëï **Swag (T-Shirt)** ‚Äî Exclusive T-shirt for **Super Contributors** (6 accepted PRs/MRs, first 10,000 only).  
- üå± **TreeNation** ‚Äî With the T-shirt reward, a tree is planted to support a greener planet.  

üëâ Even if you don‚Äôt hit the T-shirt tier, every contributor gets digital recognition and a chance to showcase their journey!

## Pitfalls & Best Practices (Don‚Äôt Become ‚ÄúSpamtoberfest‚Äù)

Over the years, maintaining event integrity and quality has been a challenge. Here are things to watch out for:

### Common Pitfalls

- Submitting many trivial PRs (e.g. white-space fixes) just to hit count  
- PRs to ineligible repos (without the `hacktoberfest` topic)  
- Not responding to maintainer feedback, resulting in PR rejections  
- Working on mega complex issues without understanding the project  
- Ignoring contribution guidelines  
- Assuming every PR will be accepted ‚Äî some valid ones might still be rejected or need revisions  

### Best Practices & Tips

1. **Aim for quality over quantity** ‚Äî better fewer meaningful contributions  
2. **Choose beginner-friendly issues first**  
3. **Communicate early** ‚Äî open an issue or comment before heavy work  
4. **Always read the project‚Äôs `CONTRIBUTING.md` / code of conduct**  
5. **Write clear PR descriptions**: what you changed, why, link to related issue  
6. **Be responsive to maintainer feedback & revise your code**  
7. **Track your PRs and deadlines** ‚Äî maintainers often leave reviews near the end of October  
8. **Don‚Äôt be discouraged by rejections** ‚Äî learn and try again
