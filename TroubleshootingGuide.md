## Registration Issues

### Issue: Can't register for Hacktoberfest
**Symptoms**: Registration button not working, error messages during signup

**Solutions**:
1. **Check Hacktoberfest Status**: Visit [hacktoberfest.com](https://hacktoberfest.com) to ensure registration is open
2. **Clear Browser Cache**: Clear cookies and cache, try incognito mode
3. **Try Different Browser**: Switch to Chrome, Firefox, or Safari
4. **Check GitHub Account**: Ensure your GitHub account is verified and active
5. **Wait and Retry**: Sometimes servers are overloaded during peak times

### Issue: "Account not eligible" error
**Solutions**:
1. **Verify Email**: Ensure your GitHub email is verified
2. **Check Account Age**: Some restrictions may apply to very new accounts
3. **Contact Support**: Reach out to Hacktoberfest support if issue persists

## Repository Eligibility

### Issue: My PRs aren't counting toward Hacktoberfest
**Symptoms**: PRs show as "ineligible" or don't appear in your Hacktoberfest dashboard

**Solutions**:
1. **Check Repository Topics**: Repository must have `hacktoberfest` topic
   ```bash
   # Check repository topics on GitHub
   # Go to repository â†’ About section â†’ Topics
   ```

2. **Verify PR Labels**: PR should be labeled `hacktoberfest-accepted` or merged
3. **Check PR Status**: Must be merged or approved, not just open
4. **Repository Must Be Public**: Private repositories don't count
5. **Check PR Date**: Must be submitted between October 1-31

### Issue: Repository doesn't have hacktoberfest topic
**Solutions**:
1. **Contact Maintainers**: Ask them to add the topic
2. **Find Alternative Repos**: Look for repositories that already have the topic
3. **Check Official Lists**: Use Hacktoberfest's official repository lists

## Pull Request Problems

### Issue: PR rejected or closed without merge
**Symptoms**: PR closed with "invalid" or "spam" labels

**Solutions**:
1. **Read Guidelines**: Carefully read CONTRIBUTING.md and README.md
2. **Improve Quality**: Ensure your contribution adds real value
3. **Follow Standards**: Match the project's coding style and conventions
4. **Add Tests**: Include tests for your changes when applicable
5. **Write Good Descriptions**: Explain what your PR does and why

### Issue: PR stuck in review
**Symptoms**: PR open for days/weeks without response

**Solutions**:
1. **Be Patient**: Maintainers are often volunteers with limited time
2. **Ping Politely**: Comment asking for status update after a week
3. **Check Activity**: Look at recent commits to see if project is active
4. **Find Alternatives**: Consider contributing to more active repositories

### Issue: Merge conflicts
**Symptoms**: "This branch has conflicts that must be resolved"

**Solutions**:
1. **Update Your Branch**:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout your-branch
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

2. **Resolve Conflicts**:
   - Open conflicted files
   - Choose which changes to keep
   - Remove conflict markers
   - Test your changes

3. **Complete Merge**:
   ```bash
   git add resolved-files
   git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
   git push origin your-branch
   ```

## Git and GitHub Issues

### Issue: "Permission denied" when pushing
**Solutions**:
1. **Check Authentication**: Ensure you're logged into GitHub
2. **Use HTTPS**: Switch from SSH to HTTPS if needed
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO.git
   ```
3. **Generate New Token**: Create a new Personal Access Token
4. **Check SSH Keys**: Verify SSH key is added to GitHub account

### Issue: "Repository not found" error
**Solutions**:

2. **Check Permissions**: Ensure you have access to the repository
3. **Fork First**: Make sure you've forked the repository
4. **Update Remote**: Check your remote URLs
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

### Issue: Can't find your fork
**Solutions**:

3. **Check Original Repo**: Look at the "Forks" section of the original repo

## Contribution Tracking

### Issue: Contributions not showing on GitHub profile
**Solutions**:
1. **Check Privacy Settings**: Ensure contributions are public
2. **Verify Email**: Use the same email for commits and GitHub account
3. **Wait for Sync**: GitHub can take up to 24 hours to update
4. **Check Date Range**: Contributions must be within the current year

### Issue: Hacktoberfest dashboard not updating
**Solutions**:
1. **Wait for Processing**: Updates can take 24-48 hours
2. **Check PR Status**: Ensure PRs are merged or labeled correctly
3. **Refresh Page**: Clear cache and refresh the dashboard
4. **Contact Support**: Reach out if issues persist after 48 hours
